# Bank_Sales_Analysis

## Project Background

Nowadays, marketing expenditures in the banking industry are massive, meaning that it is essential 
for banks to optimize marketing strategies and improve effectiveness. Understanding customers’ need 
leads to more effective marketing plans, smarter product designs and greater customer satisfaction. 

## Main Objectives: 
By analysing customer features, such as demographics and transaction history, the bank will be able 
to predict customer saving behaviours and identify which type of customers is more likely to make 
term deposits. The bank can then focus its marketing efforts on those customers. This will not only 
allow the bank to secure deposits more effectively but also increase customer satisfaction by reducing 
undesirable advertisements for certain customers. 

## About the Data 
There are 45,211 observations in the dataset, with no missing values. Each represents an existing 
customer that the bank reached via phone calls. For each observation, the dataset records 17 input 
variables that stand for both qualitative and quantitative attributes of the customers. 
There is a single binary output variable that denotes “yes”(1) or “no(0)” revealing the outcomes of the 
marketing phone calls. "Yes" means that a customer subscribed to term deposits.
